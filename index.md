# About me

**15+ Years | Cloud & Dev Expert**

I'm a highly skilled software engineer with over 15 years of experience.
I help businesses like yours thrive by crafting cloud-based solutions, developing robust software,
and empowering your team through training and coaching.

## My career

- After leaving school, I started studying computer science at the University of Koblenz in
  **2004**, which I finished with a diploma (similar to M.Sc.) in 2012
- Parallel to my studies, I started working for
  [wer-kennt-wen.de](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werkenntwen) in **2008** as a PHP developer and
  later as head of development
- In **2014** I changed my career direction and decided to become a freelancer

## My values

I have come to the conclusion that only consistent **clean IT architecture and development** leads
to success.
Hereby I am guided by the values of
[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

I think the collaboration and the human components are just as important as the technical ones.
The sooner the right people have the right responsibilities, the better a product will succeed.
It is impressive how much a **good team** can achieve.
